# 👋 Hey, I'm **Shivam**
### Welcome to my playground !!

I am a curious builder who enjoys untangling messy problems — whether they come from data, humans, or the chaotic systems they create together.

I spend my time exploring dashboards, ETL pipelines, forecasting models, and the occasional “why-is-this-even-happening” SQL puzzle. 
Self-taught by nature. Root-cause thinker by temperament. Driven primarily by curiosity.
