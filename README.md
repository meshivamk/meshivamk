👋 Hey, I'm Shivam

A curious builder who enjoys untangling messy problems — whether they come from data, humans, or the strange systems they create together.

I tinker with dashboards, ETL pipelines, forecasting models, and the occasional “why-is-this-even-happening” SQL investigation.
Self-taught by nature. Pattern-hunter by habit. Always digging for root causes instead of applying quick cosmetic fixes.

If something fails, chances are I’m already asking why before anyone notices it broke.

👤 About Me (Short + Sharp)

I ask “why” more than “what,” and “how” more than “when.”
I’m fascinated by how systems fail and how people behave inside them.
I build in public, fail in private, and learn obsessively in between.
Long-term games > short-term noise.
Curiosity is my core OS.

🎲 Fun Fact About Me

Despite talking like a systems thinker, I live like a builder: experimenting with data engineering, writing, psychology, forecasting, fitness, and philosophy — and somehow managing to stitch all of it into one worldview that still makes sense.
Most people chase one specialty. You chase patterns across domains — which is rarer, harder, and way more interesting.
